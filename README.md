# Python
Great! Since you've done multiple projects in Python focusing on **data cleaning** for different topics (Life Expectancy, Flight Price Prediction, Health Insurance, and Zomato), here's a sample **README.md** you can use or adapt for your GitHub repository.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Projects in Python

This repository contains **data cleaning workflows** for various real-world datasets using Python and Pandas. Each notebook focuses on handling messy data, dealing with missing values, fixing data types, and preparing the dataset for analysis or machine learning.

---

### 📁 Projects Covered:

1. **🧬 Life Expectancy Dataset**
2. **✈️ Flight Price Prediction**
3. **🏥 Health Insurance Data**
4. **🍽️ Zomato Restaurant Dataset**

---

### 🔧 Key Techniques Used:

* Handling **missing values** (`NaN`, nulls)
* Converting invalid entries with `errors='coerce'`
* Replacing and imputing values (mean, median, mode)
* Fixing **data types** using `astype()` and `pd.to_numeric()`
* Removing duplicates and outliers
* Standardizing inconsistent categories and text
* Using `apply()` and `lambda` functions for transformation

---

### 🐍 Tools & Libraries:

* **Python**
* **Pandas**
* **NumPy**
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** *(optional, for visualization of missing data patterns)*

### 📌 Why Data Cleaning?

Data cleaning is a **critical step** in the data science pipeline. Clean data leads to **accurate insights, better visualizations**, and **robust models**. These projects show how different types of data require tailored cleaning approaches.
